# 3D_STL_Editor

I created this project for my Master's Thesis to render a 3D model from .STL files and enable the user to perform some editing operations on single/multiple faces. Written in Javascript + JSC3D library.


This model is currently running at http://efoundry.iitb.ac.in/Academy/index.jsp?left=leftHome
